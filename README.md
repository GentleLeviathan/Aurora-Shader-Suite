# Aurora Shader Suite
Requires Unity 2019.1.x or greater.
Includes output template for Substance Painter.

A suite of tools and a shader for a personal project. Takes advantage of a texture swizzle ('Aurora') to represent Metallic, Occlusion, Emission, and Curvature.

Unique features include:
  * 4 channel color masking via an RGBA color control texture (3 channels have color properties)
  * Per color mask channel pattern support (useful for camouflage or fabric)
  * Color 'depth' for increasing texture contrast via slider
  * Detail diffuse and normal with strength slider and tiling/offset vector
  * Decal textures applied via mesh UV2 for text/image clarity

Includes a set of 'Helper' tools, including:
  * OpenGL to DirectX normal format (and vice-versa)
  * Tool to pack traditional Metallic_Smoothness, Occlusion, Emission, and Curvature textures into the 'Aurora' swizzle format.
  * Material baking (for applying shader color zones, patterns, and depth to a new diffuse texture to be used elsewhere.)

And a few additional helpers to enable the use of assets inspired by Microsoft's 'Halo' games.
Supports armor sets and textures from the following 'Halo' games:

* Halo Reach
* Halo: Combat Evolved
* Halo 2
* Halo 3: ODST
* Halo 3
* Halo 4 (Storm)
* Halo 5: Forge
